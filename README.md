# Enterprise COBOL - syntax highlighting for highlight.js

Based on the otterkit package: https://github.com/otterkit/highlightjs-cobol, contains several improvements as of the writing:
Better regex (several bugs fixed and minor optimization done), better TypeScript support, and AUTHOR has been added to the list of reserved words so it will be highlighted (just like IBM Z Open Editor's highlighter does).


# Installation
